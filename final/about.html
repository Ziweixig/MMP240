            <p>Breed: Shih Tzu mix</p>
            <p>Hello, I’m Joey! Aren’t I the cutest little creature you’ve ever seen? I’ve got the most adorable underbid, and my front legs are somewhat twisted in a condition down as ‘valgus,’ which is harmless and doesn’t bother me. I enjoy hanging around most other small dogs, and particularly love a good scratch under the chin. Adopt me!</p>
