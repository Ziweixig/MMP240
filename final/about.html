            <p>Age: 4 years</p>
            <p>Sex: Male</p>
            <p>Breed: Dutch Shepherd mix</p> 
            <p>Weight: 64 lbs </p>
            <p>I’m Armani and I came to Animal Haven from a shelter in Connecticut. I’m a super playful, energetic boy who loves going on walks and hikes. I’d do best in a home with adults and adult children, and if you had some dog handling experience with larger dogs that would be a great too!  I’m good with most other dogs but still haven’t met a cat before.  But if you have a cat, staff at Animal Haven can cat test me so it might work out! I’d just love someone who could spend a lot of time with me being active. I LOVE getting to go outside! Won’t you please come down and meet me? I’m a staff favorite and a very special boy.</p>

            <p>Age: 10 years
            <p>Sex: Mal</p>
            <p>Breed: Shih Tzu mix</p>
            <p>Hello, I’m Joey! Aren’t I the cutest little creature you’ve ever seen? I’ve got the most adorable underbid, and my front legs are somewhat twisted in a condition down as ‘valgus,’ which is harmless and doesn’t bother me. I enjoy hanging around most other small dogs, and particularly love a good scratch under the chin. Adopt me!</p>
