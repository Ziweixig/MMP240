            <h2>Adoption</h2>
            <p>Every single animal and every single New Yorker has their own back-story, their own lineage, their own 'look' and yet all share an unbreakable devotion to our city that sets us apart from the rest of the world. In short, New Yorkers are a different breed. That's how we came up with the term 'boroughbred'.</p>

            <p>Lost & Found</p>
            <p>Many of ACC's animals are lost pets. To ensure the return of your missing pet, ACC encourages you to have current identification on your animal in the form of a license or microchip so that if your pet comes into our Care Centers, we can return your pet to you. If you've lost your pet, you can search for your pet at any one of our three full-service Care Centers open seven days a week. We suggest that you visit all of the Centers in the area on a regular basis for your lost pet. For more information and details on finding your lost pet, or if you have found a lost pet, please visit our Lost & Found page.</p>
