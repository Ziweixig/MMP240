        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Best Friends Animal Society is on the ground in New York City, helping to save the lives of homeless pets and supporting other organizations in their efforts to make New York no-kill permanently. Every day, more than 4,100 dogs and cats are killed in shelters across the country - but with Best Friends Animal Society leading the way, and your support, we can help our nation's shelters and Save Them All. The Best Friends Pet Adoption Center in New York City serves as both a space for local pets to find homes, and an outlet for the national no-kill message, helping to spread the word about Best Friends’ efforts to lead the country to no-kill by 2025.</p>
       
        <h2>Adopt Center</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The Best Friends Pet Adoption Center in New York City is a wonderful place to find your new pet. Welcoming and friendly, it’s full of dogs and cats who are microchipped, vaccinated, spayed or neutered, and ready to go home with you. Each pet comes from a shelter or rescue group in New York City or the surrounding tri-state area, and each is looking for someone like you to call family. When you adopt a pet from Best Friends, you’re part of a truly lifesaving force in Manhattan. The center is also a great place to get Best Friends gear. We stock a variety of Best Friends–themed merchandise to help you not only look stylish, but also spread the word about the work of Best Friends. And every purchase you make helps the animals. </p>

        <h2>Training Center</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Want to get your puppy off on the right paw? Start training as early as possible. This way your dog can begin his new life by developing good routines and habits right from the start. Although puppies receive much of their socialization from their mothers and litter mates in the first 12 weeks of life, you are now your puppy’s pack leader and need to pick up where his birth mother left off as a puppy trainer. Best Friend Puppy Management Program can start a few days after your dog settles into his/her new home. Puppies have short attention spans, so the home environment is the best place to get your puppy to focus. Crate training puppies, house training puppies, and lead training puppies are primary areas in which your puppy will begin his education to become a good canine citizen. Although puppies tire easily, they are often balls of energy! It is important that your puppy doesn’t get too bored or the mischief will surely begin. One way to keep your dog occupied (particularly while you are not home) is to buy him a GameChanger dog toy developed exclusively. </p>
